# nutrient_pt

This is a collaborative project with the aim of tidying and visualising nutritional data. The goal is to develop a simple shiny app to help the user quickly search, compare and visualize nutritional data of single or combined food ingredients. 


In order to help manage the development of the Shiny App a checklist with ideas and tasks is available: `Ideas_list_checklist.md`
