### App features

# Compare food ingredients and prepare recipes
# Add & Remove buttons change input_current$ingredients.
# input_current$ingredients is a reactive value, which means that 
# the dependants of this will be notified if this changes.
# nutri_filtered depends on input_current$ingredients.
# nutri_sum depends on nutri_filtered.
# output$RecipeTable depends on nutri_sum.
# There is a cascading effect of several things being updated

# Note: nutri_filtered also depends on input$NutrientSub, but we want 
# it to update the table only when we press the AddIngredient. Since 
# the input$NutrientSub is reactive, we need to remove its reactiveness
# by using isolate(). This means that nutri_filtered wants to use the 
# NutrientSub value, but does not want to be notified as soon as the 
# value changes because this would cause a cascading effect up to the 
# table being updated.
